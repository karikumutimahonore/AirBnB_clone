# The AirBnB clone project - The Console

## Project background

The **AirBnB clone - The console** project is the first step in building a fullstack web application.
It focuses on building models that will be used by future projects.

## The command interpreter

The job of the command interpreter is to help manage the objects used in the project. It would do the
following:

- Creates a new object (e.g. a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
